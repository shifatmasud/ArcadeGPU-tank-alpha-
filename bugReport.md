# Bug Report Log

Tracking all issues, from critical bugs to minor suggestions.

## Critical (App Breaking)

-   **[RESOLVED] PROJECTILE PHYSICS DESYNC**: Shells weren't passing rotation to Jolt. Visually rotated, physically axis-aligned. Fixed by passing Euler-to-Quat to `addBox`.
-   **[RESOLVED] RECOIL CLIPPING**: Projectiles spawned at static offsets while barrel was recoiling, causing shells to spawn inside the turret. Fixed with dynamic muzzle offset.
-   **[RESOLVED] ELASTIC BOUNCE BUG**: Shells didn't explode on walls because speed didn't drop (elastic collision). Fixed by checking vector direction changes.
-   **[RESOLVED] THE 12-METER SAFE ZONE**: Projectiles were "invulnerable" for too long (0.1s), letting shells bounce off nearby walls without exploding. Fixed by tightening the window.
